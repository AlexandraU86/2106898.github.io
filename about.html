    <div class="col-sm-8 p-4 "> <p> Many successful businesses started off with only one person who had a vision and the necessary technical skills to deliver it to the world and META NAVIS follows the same pattern.<br> 
	Our start was relatively recent, in 2018. It was all about ship design and technical assistance and it soon became a success.
	In 2021, identifying a niche opportunity in the shipbuilding market, the company increased its size and agreed to offer its services under a new name: META NAVIS.</p>
	<p> Basically, META NAVIS is a response to the need for better quality work in ship design and shipbuilding industries that are facing an increase in poor design services and non-technical solutions delivery.<br>
	We all agree that that design errors can substantially lessen the quality of the deliverable, cause project delays and huge cost overruns.
	Here at META NAVIS, we have gained our experience by working with shipyards and design houses all over Europe (Finland, France, Germany, Scotland, Romania) and believe it’s the right time to share our experience and knowledge with medium-sized ship design companies and shipyards.</p>
	<p> We are your go-to support partner for <strong> DESIGN PACKAGE REVIEWS and TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE</strong>.</p>
	<p class= "lead">What does it mean for you? </p> 
	Let’s be fair, big engineering companies also have big running costs and their price will reflect those.
	At META NAVIS, we fine-tune our skills by working in some of the major ship design companies and shipyards in Europe. <br> Our team of experienced engineers is small but effective and is scalable to your needs. Our running costs will not reflect in the price you pay, only the work delivered will. You get what you pay for. And that’s engineering solutions that will help you increase the quality of your deliverables.</div>
